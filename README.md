# Project Overview

## 🚀 What is Astro?

**Astro** is a modern front-end framework designed to build fast websites with minimal JavaScript. It focuses on content-first development and provides the flexibility to use various frameworks like React, Vue, Svelte, and more while ensuring your site is lightweight and optimized for performance. Astro generates static HTML by default, which helps in improving SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and page load speeds.

## 🎨 What is Tailwind CSS?

**Tailwind CSS** is a utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to build custom designs quickly. Instead of writing custom CSS, you apply pre-defined classes directly in your HTML. This approach allows for rapid development and makes it easy to adjust the design of your site without writing a lot of extra code.

## 🪄 What is Shadcn?

**Shadcn** is a component library that works well with Tailwind CSS. It provides a set of pre-built, customizable UI components that can be used in your projects to make design and development faster and easier. The components are designed with accessibility and responsiveness in mind, ensuring they work well across different devices and screen sizes. By integrating Shadcn, you can quickly enhance the user interface without needing to build everything from scratch.
